Then, in the extracted exe, you will click on the file extracted exe, and navigate to find the exe file. That part is key.

C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\IncrediboxPack\IncrediboxPack

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username. It should be pretty self explanatory to find.

Then, double click the Incredibox.exe. It should look something like this:

Then, you are all set!

(P.S: It may take up to 3 1/2 minutes, depending on your computer. Very good computers can generally finish this in like 1 minute.)

If you want to be extra careful, wait up to 5 minutes before closing the Incredibox program. Closing it preemptively when it is still loading could cause future bugs when you redownload Incredibox Elemental Pack again.
