Incredibox Elemental Pack is a helpful tool for making your Incredibox or Scratch games come to life with an exe! It also has numerous toolkits to help beginner coders or people who may not be too familar with coding or debugging, etc to have an easier time!


# Guide on How to Use

On this page, you will want to navigate to the releases section. I have made a giant arrow so you can see where it is

Then, click on the hyperlink that says "IncrediboxPack.zip" (yeah i know, i'm very creative with the naming. so creative ;-;)

Then, download the Zip by clicking on it and extract all.

Then, in the extracted exe, you will click on the file extracted exe, and navigate to find the exe file. That part is key.

C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\IncrediboxPack\IncrediboxPack

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username. It should be pretty self explanatory to find.

Then, double click the Incredibox.exe. It should look something like this:

Then, you are all set!

(P.S: It may take up to 3 1/2 minutes, depending on your computer. Very good computers can generally finish this in like 1 minute.)

If you want to be extra careful, wait up to 5 minutes before closing the Incredibox program. Closing it preemptively when it is still loading could cause future bugs when you redownload Incredibox Elemental Pack again.

# Fixing Known Issues 

There are some issues I am trying to fix, but some may be difficult to patch/solve. I have found some fixes on the user level.

**Fixing SmartScreen Error**

If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click "Run Anyways". You may need to click "more info" to see this option. This warning is entirely harmless and just a small "tap on the shoulder". It shows because the app is not signed. Signing it can cost up to $2,000 a year!

This is the SmartScreen that appears on **my Incredibox Program** and up to **95% of other programs in an average user's system.:** (https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/many-unsigned-executables-ship-with-windows.1268679/)

To solve this, you would want to click on "More info". It is right here:

Then, click on Run anyways (if you wanna run the program ofc):

If you are still cautious of the program, I would advise you to read the source code. And also, SmartScreen has 2 different types. The one I showed you before was what my program and **95%** of what other programs display when ran. The other one is for malicious programs, which would clearly show on your computer.


This is an example of a **malicious program:**

However, our program does NOT show the malicious SmartScreen thing. This is to clarify people who may be a bit skeptical about the program, and it's totally okay! 


# Program Shutting Down Abruptly

On all my documented cases, this happens on the installation stage. The reason is you are not using a supported device. 
For now, the only supported program is Windows. We are planning to expand to Mac, Linux and Ubuntu in the near future.
